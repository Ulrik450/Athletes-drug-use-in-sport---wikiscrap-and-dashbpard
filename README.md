# Athletes drug use in sport - wikiscrap and dashbpard
 In this project, I have scraped Wikipedia for all athletes who have tested positive in drug tests. The project provides code for scraping Wikipedia and code for creating a dashboard that visualizes:  The most used drugs,  The sport with the most athletes testing positive,  A timeline showing athletes tested positive for drug use,  A world map displaying the number of athletes tested positive for drug use, associated with their respective countries.  The project already includes the scraped Wikipedia pages and athlete pages used in the analysis, as well as a CSV file containing information about the athletes. The code language is Python.
